# Exchange Rate Forecasting Using Machine Learning
1- This Project is based on Supervised Machine Learning and solves a Regression problem.

2- The goal of this project is to predict the value of exchange rate of Pakistan against US Dollar.

3- All variables in this project are supported by prior literature and have theoretical significance for USD/PKR prediction

4- Machine Learning models used in this project can be utilized by Investors, Businesses and Policy makers to predict exchange rate of Pakistan against US Dollar.

# Dataset
Data for this project was obtained from Investing.com. Daily observations for Opening, Closing, High, Low, and Change values for USD/PKR rate, KSE-100 Index, International Gold Prices, Brent Oil Prices, and S&P 500 were used. 

# Models used for Prediction
1- OLS 

2- Decision Trees

3- Random Forest

4- XGBoost

5- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

# Results
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) stands out as the best model with the lowest average mean squared error on both the testing and validation sets, showcasing balanced performance across Training and Validation datasets. It surpasses OLS, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, making it the most effective choice for accurate predictions on unseen data. It can also be noted that the artificial neural network has the lowest MSE of 0.0096 on training data.
